# :beers: Aw, Nuts :beer:

I love beer. I hate nuts (because I'm allergic). Some beers are made with nuts, and those beers will kill me. This is a list of them (and brews I suspected having nuts -- but actually don't!) for my future reference.

# Format
- Alphabetized brewery (+ link)
  - Alphabetic name of beer (+ link on brewery's website, if possible; otherwise, RateBeer, Untappd, BeerAdvocate, etc. works)
    - Why I know the beer has nuts OR why I thought the beer has nuts and actually doesn't

  - [B/A/Y/S [black as your soul]](https://www.adroit-theory.com/beers)
    - Apparently, there's a ton of these. I'm not sure which I picked up, but I believe it was brewed with hazelnuts. There's definitely ones that aren't brewed with nuts. I advise caution and just calling up the brewery if you're concerned.

    - It's a stout. But, I called Champion to verify no nuts were used, and they said no nuts were used.

    - From their website, "We brewed The Fear with a local pumpkin puree and secret blend of spices." I'm cool with secrets, except not when it might inadvertently kill me. However, I've had this a bunch of time, and I'm all good.

    - [This review](http://beerstreetjournal.com/southern-tier-cold-press-coffee-pumking/) describes it as "nutty," and I also thought it tasted nutty. Turns out, that's just the coffee. Check the beer's page for more information on its brewing process.

### Pumpkin Beers
Since a lot of the pumpkin beers fall on this list for the same reason, I figured it was easier to link to the same reasoning, which is:
- Pumpkin beers that just say "with spices" make me nervous, because I've seen other beers that say "with spices," but it also means "with nuts." However, I've drank this, and I'm still alive!

# More information
- I've nearly drank beers brewed with nuts on at least 4 occasions before a quick Google search. Hopefully this list will help me (and others) in the future.
- I don't actually know that beer brewed with nuts causes an allergic reaction for me (or for anyone), but I'd rather be safe.
- I'll add to this periodically, as I try and sample new beers (and remember, "Hey, I should probably update that beer list that I started...").
- Many of the beers are seasonal and show up in the Fall and Winter. 
- Many are stouts, spiced ales, and pumpkin beers. I've seen pecans, hazelnuts, and almonds used to flavor these before.
